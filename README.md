# Data Journalism and D3

### Note: You'll need to use `python -m http.server` to run the visualization. This will host the page at `localhost:8000` in your web browser. See [screenshot](https://github.com/lyli888/Level-12-D3/blob/main/Interactive%20ToolTip%20Graph%20Screenshot.png) for project results & tooltips on mouse-click. Plotly is built on D3.

You need to create a scatter plot between two of the data variables in the dataset from the csv file, `Lack of Healthcare vs. Poverty in % for each state plus the District of Columbia`.

Using the D3 techniques we taught you in class, create a scatter plot that represents each state with circle elements. You'll code this graphic in the `app.js` file of your homework directoryâ€”make sure you pull in the data from `data.csv` by using the `d3.csv` function. 

* Include state abbreviations in the circles.

* Create and situate your axes and labels to the left and bottom of the chart.

* Add a clickable tooltip for each circle that gives full state name, along with specific X (% in Poverty) & Y (% Lacking Healthcare) values for each circle.
